# Predicted body weight and volume conversion

[conditions, sources and permissions](https://elucenia.org/en/tools/peso-predito-volume-corrente)

## How to use

Use the tool in the portal or open index.html through a local HTTP server. Select the language, complete the fields and calculate.

## Inputs and units

### Sex

`sexo`

- `M` — Male
- `F` — Female

### Height

`altura`

cm · range: 120–220

### Protocol volume per predicted body weight

`mlkg`

mL/kg · range: 4–8

## Method edition

ARDS Network 2000; PBW and conversion using the entered coefficient

## Documented formula

PBW = 50 + 0.91(height−152.4) in men or 45.5 + 0.91(height−152.4) in women. Mathematical volume = PBW × entered coefficient.

## Limits and population

The main result is PBW, not a ventilator adjustment. Does not automatically select 6 mL/kg; coefficient, eligibility, pressures and titration depend on the clinical protocol.
